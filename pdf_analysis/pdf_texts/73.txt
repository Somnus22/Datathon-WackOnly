Investigation into the allegation that a UNON/ITS staff member obtained money from
UNPOS on the promise that s/he would facilitate the installation of the New York tie-line
connection to the RSG residence.

(ID/OIOS Case No. 0575/03)

I. INTRODUCTION

1. In October 2003, the Investigations Division of Office of Internal Oversight Services
(ID/OIOS) received information that in May 2003 UNON/ITS Staff Member, a staff member in
the Information Technology Service of the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON/ITS),
solicited and obtained Ksh 22,250 (US$294.70) with the promise to extend a New York tie-line
satellite connection from the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) to the
residence of the Representative of the Secretary General. Given the low priority of this case, it
was investigated when time and resources permitted. The investigation is now complete.

Il. METHODOLOGY

3. ID/OIOS reviewed documents relevant to the investigation and researched pertinent
United Nations rules and regulations as well as local laws. ID/OIOS also interviewed witnesses
in UNON, UNPOS and UNDP offices in Nairobi.

IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

4. UNPOS is a mission set up by the Department of Political Affairs (DPA) and is headed
by a Representative of the Secretary General (RSG). UNPOS is based at the UNON compound
in Gigiri, Kenya and receives common services support from UNON.

Vv. INVESTGATIVE DETAILS

5. ID/OIOS interviewed various members of the UNPOS staff who provided the following
information. The UNPOS Official wished to extend the New York tie-line satellite connection
from the RSG office to the RSG residence. His/her staff located the UNON/ITS Staff Member who
said s/he could provide the connection with the purchase of a few items of equipment. UNPOS
requested, on 15 May 2003, that a cheque for Kshs 22,250 be issued to the UNON/ITS Staff
Member for this purpose, which s/he cashed. However, s/he never provided the service, nor did
s/he return the money when asked. On 27 August 2003 the UNPOS Official’s administrative
assistant made a formal request to the UNON Official for the installation and on 7 October 2003
a letter from UNPOS signed by the UNPOS Official to the UNON Official alleged that the
UNON/ITS Staff Member had promised this service, received payment but had not provided the
service or returned the money.

6. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON/ITS Staff Member, who claimed that his/her verbal
proposal to UNPOS was that s/he would prepare the equipment for the satellite link, but that
installation was to be carried out by a licensed company. S/he said that the payment to him/her
was only for preparation of the equipment. S/he explained that his/her advice that the satellite
connection was possible was based on his/her projected use of required equipment that was lying
unused in the UNON workshop. However, s/he did not get approval for the use of this
equipment at the time of his/her proposal from his/her supervisor, the UNON Official, who was
on leave. When s/he did speak to the UNON Official, s/he was told that the equipment could not
be used by UNPOS and that UNPOS should initiate a procurement procedure for the job or
arrange to purchase and install the equipment itself. The UNON/ITS Staff Member gave this
information to the UNPOS Official’s administrative assistant. S/he told ID/OIOS that s/he was
willing to refund the money, but had not done so.

7. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON Official. S/he stated that upon receipt of the formal
request for installation of the satellite link, s/he informed UNPOS that the equipment required
would cost $11,560. S/he told ID/OIOS that the proper procedure to obtain this link required
UNPOS to make a formal request to his/her office and, after its approval, a procurement process
would take place. Due to limitations of staff and a lack of licensing authority, UNON/IT could

Page 4:
play an advisory role, but the company that won the bid would provide equipment and
installation.

8. The UNON Official also told ID/OIOS said s/he had not known of the UNON/ITS Staff
Member’s initiative until after s/he received UNPOS’ formal request for the satellite link. After
receipt of the UNPOS Official’s letter of 7 October 2003, s/he referred the matter to the UNON
Security and Safety Unit for investigation.

VI. FINDINGS

9. UNPOS attempted to achieve an extension of the satellite link from its office to the
residence of the RSG. A verbal arrangement was made with the UNON/ITS Staff Member and
payment arranged for him/her of Ksh 22,250.

10. While the UNON/ITS Staff Member claimed that s/he told UNPOS that s/he was using
the money to purchase equipment to repair a power supply for the project and that installation
would have to be carried out by a licensed company, UNPOS’ claim that the agreement was that
the UNON/ITS Staff Member was to handle the entire project for this sum is supported by the
evidence.

11. The UNON/ITS Staff Member had intended to use expensive equipment from the UNON
workshop, but did not receive permission to do so from his/her supervisor prior to his/her
arrangement with UNPOS. When the UNON Official learned of these arrangements, s/he told
the UNON/ITS Staff Member the equipment could not be used by UNPOS and that a request for
extension of the satellite link must go though the proper channels.

12. UNPOS did not receive an extension of its satellite link to the residence and the
UNON/ITS Staff Member did not return the money paid him/her.
VII. CONCLUSION

13. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite link to the RSG residence, receiving
money for said undertaking, failing to provide the satellite link and refusing to return the money
paid to him/her, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obligations under Staff
Regulation 1.2
14. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite link to the RSG residence, the
UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obligations under The Financial Regulations
and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2003/7, Regulation 5.12.
