Japan Seeks Long-Term Pact With Specific Figures on Climate Change at G-8 (TS//SI//NF)

(TS//SI//NF) Japan, preparing for its role as chairman of the Group-of-8 (G-8) summit at Lake
Toya early in July, has given notice that it intends to strive for a long-term commitment on
climate change with specific figures, while Germany believes that the crucial issue at the summit
is whether the U.S. will accept going beyond Heiligendamm (the site of last year's G-8 summit)
language in the framework of the G-8 if the emerging countries do not accept numerical targets
at the Major Economies Meeting (MEM). (According to press reports, leaders from 16 countries,
including the members of the G-8 plus China, India, Brazil, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea,
South Africa, and Mexico, plan to discuss climate change on the margins of the G-8 summit in
Japan.) Masaharu Kono, Japan's G-8 sherpa, emphasized Tokyo's position in an exchange with
his German counterpart, Bernd Pfaffenback, on 17 June, while Pfaffenback provided his
country's take on the issues to be addressed at Lake Toya. The German also noted that, in
response to a U.S. request, his country would likely give up its demand for a 25- to 45-percent
mid-term carbon dioxide reduction at the MEM. In addition, he does not believe that the
emerging economies are willing to go beyond the Bali language at present, his feeling being
that they prefer instead to wait until next year's G-8 summit in Copenhagen, because they do
not wish to give up things now that they might be prepared to give up later. It is also
Pfaffenback's position that a failure of the emerging economies to accept a long-term goal with
numbers, even in brackets, would pose difficulties for the G-8 and possibly lead to a clash at the
summit itself if there is no fallback position.
